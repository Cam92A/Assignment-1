  <h1>Personal Information</h1>
  <h2>My interest in IT</h2>
  <p>• What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</p>
  <p>I believe that our futures are going to be inextricably intertwined with ever changing and adapting technologies that have more and more profound effects on nearly every facet of the world we know, and I would like to be a part of that.
My background is predominantly through self-teaching to troubleshoot issues I have come across. I am also a forward observer in the which is a communications heavy role and requires some IT knowledge and abilities specific to the radio and computer systems we use.
</p>
<p>• Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</p>
<p>I am taking this course to learn and gain admission into a computer science degree and then later an electronics and communications engineering degree. The degrees are with the goal of working towards a position in Defence industry developing new technologies to enhance the communications, electronic warfare capabilities.
RMIT offered an opportunity to do this online and without the need for bridging courses or entrance tests.
</p>
<p>• What do you expect to learn during your studies?</p>
<p>I expect to learn the basics of IT and programming in the first two subjects and then a more in depth but still high-level overview in computer science once I gain entry. Specifically, I intend to learn and understand the relevant programming languages and what the best application for each is. I also will be learning how to build and wire a computer/processor and other hardware etc.

<h2>Why this appeals to me</h2>
<p>Military radio communications are a part of my current role in Defence. The inner workings of these have always fascinated me and I really want to learn how the software aspect of the radios.
Along with this I enjoy leading a team and being able to teach so a long term goal of a managerial position suits me well.</p>

<h3>Skills, Qualifications and Experience </h3>
<p>You would require substantial experience in software engineering as well as an understanding of military application and how the hardware is manufactured and used in the field, a software engineering degree, management experience, any relevant government security clearances would be required and experience as an end user would be useful.</p>

<p>I only have the operator skills of several L3harris products and the ability to perform operator level maintenance. I also have the skills to program radio networks.I have some management experience also and i hold a security clearance. </p>

<h4>My Roadmap</h4>
<p>My plan for moving towards this position is to complete enough modules in the Bachelor of IT to gain entrance to a Bachelor of Computer Science and then later do a Bachelor of Software Engineering or equivalent. In the meantime, I will be working on projects which increase my understanding of the hardware and software development process and ideally trying to find an internship or work in this space so I can gain some industry experience while I learn. One obstacle will be obtaining the PV security clearance as I already have NV1 it will help to expediate the whole process.

  <h2>CAREER TEST</h2>
  <h4>MAIN ABILITY</h4>
  <p>Leadership</p>

  <h2>My work values</h2>
  <p>Values are individual beliefs that motivate you in your everyday life. Work values are the beliefs that will motivate you in your career. When choosing a career, you should aim for a career that fits with as many of your work values as possible. This will help you remain motivated throughout your education, and any challenges you may face, as well as help you excel in your chosen career path.</p>

  <h6>Making a difference</h6>
  <p>You value the ability to make a positive impact in your community of the environment. To incorporate this value into your work, you need to identify the causes you’re most passionate about. Whether it is the environment, social justice, animal advocacy, once you identify the cause you’re passionate about, you can start brainstorming a list of careers that have positive impacts on those causes. Working for a cause you’re passionate about will help you to stay motivated throughout the challenges in your career and it will ultimately lead you to a career you can be proud of.</p>

  <h6>Creativity</h6>
  <p>You’re a creative individual and you want to portray that in your work. Whether you display your creativity through art or through coming up with innovative ideas within your field, you’re best suited for a career with a flexible environment that allows room, and that encourages creative pursuits.  Now don’t be fooled by the stereotype regarding this work value, creativity doesn’t necessarily mean you should pursue a career in the arts. Consider all your interests and then you can brainstorm potential careers within those fields that allow room for creative pursuits.</p>

  <h6>Success</h6>
  <p>You’re driven by success and you value a career that will result in clear indications of success based on all the great work you put in. To choose the career that works best for you, you first need to define what success means for you. For some people, success can mean high financial rewards, or awards and celebrations, or being happy with your work every day. Once you identify what success means for you, brainstorm a list of careers that can provide you that kind of success.</p>

  <h6>Leadership</h6>
  <p>You enjoy leading others and guiding them to accomplish their projects. This is highly valued by employers as it means you’ll have the drive to lead their employees to meet organisational benchmarks. When choosing a career, consider the fields you’re interested in, ensure you excel in the skills and knowledge necessary to work in that field, and look up different leadership opportunities. As a leader, you can also consider working for yourself if you consider that you have the structure and skills necessary to lead your own entrepreneurship.</p>

  <h6>Challenge</h6>
  <p>You value a workspace that regularly throws new and exciting challenges your way. Routine may not be your cup of tea, instead you are most likely to thrive in a fast-paced environment with tough challenges and aggressive deadlines. If you find that you work best under pressure, you’ll find opportunities to work on challenges in academia, the healthcare industry, the public sector, the legal field, and many more. </p>

  <h6>Control</h6>
  <p>You like having a sense of control over the things you do. When working on projects, you want to be the one dividing the work, setting the timelines, and leading the regular progress tracking meetings. As someone that values control, you either want to find yourself in a leadership position where you can call the shots or in a very independent position where you’re granted the ability to make changes as necessary without other’s approval. Working as a self-employed individual assures you a high level of control regarding your work.</p>

  <h6>Work-life balance</h6>
  <p>Work-life balance is a very important matter for you. As much as you may plan to love your job, it’s important for you that the job gives you plenty of time and head space to spend on leisure and the things you love. When looking for a career, ensure to not settle for careers that hint at extremely busy work weeks and that hint lots of overtime as they will not give you the balance you require. Aim to obtain a job where you can leave your work at the office and you don’t need to take it home either physically or mentally as it may impact the time you should spend enjoying on your leisure activities.</p>

  <h6>Strong relationships</h6>
  <p>You like building and maintaining strong relationships. You tend to be an extrovert and a people person, interacting with others can sometimes be the highlight of your day. You many benefit from positions that have you interacting with the public throughout the day. Your people skills will be useful to these positons as they will impact client retention in the service business.</p>

  <h3>My Take aways</h3>
  <p>The results of these tests all seem to indicate that I could lead effectively which is consistent with my current work experience where I ran a business with several employees and more recently in Defence where I act in leadership positions where higher rank is unavailable as well as instructing PT for the unit, I am a part of. In this light I believe whilst I would like to learn the technical know how I ultimately will be aiming for management/ leadership positions in the IT industry.</p>

  <p>I want to be a leader that clears obstacles and facilitates the best possible working environments for everyone in the team this has been my philosophy and I would like to continue this however I would like to grow in this role, and I will make sure to encourage criticism of my style so that I can constantly develop and grow to do a better job for the people I work with. </p>

  <p>Initially I think the most important thing is to be a good follower and not let my style cause me to clash when integrating with a new team instead supporting others’ views and encouraging the adoption of other people’s ideas rather than trying to tell them what I think is best. </p>

  <h1>My Project idea</h1>
  <h2>game compiler/organiser</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>The app will be a tool to load a list of video games onto along with information such as the average time to complete and to 100 percent. It will then help to organize and prioritise all your games into a self-generated list with a built-in calendar so that the user can plan out a way to play through their backlog of video games.</p>
  <p>Into the future the functionality of a forum of sorts will be added so that stories and discord along with screenshots and short clips allowing for community to help each other to complete and enjoy games.</p>

  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>Motivation for this project is to create a companion app to help catalogue and plan or schedule a way to play through all the games that you may have collected. Today we have services like steam and other gaming platforms, which offer near instant access to thousands of current titles, with hundreds more being added regularly and often going on sale sometimes just for a few dollars, not to mention the swath of free to play titles that are available. This creates a very real dilemma of “how do I play through all these games” and this can be so overwhelming sometimes that it seems impossible to keep up. This app aims to help outline a plan and give some structure so that you can enjoy all your favourite games and share your experiences whilst doing so.</p>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>The data base - The app would be a database or list of games added by the user, this list will be divided into completed, playing, play next and on hold sections offering a way to visualize the users backlog and to have a basic idea of how and when they will tackle their backlog. </p>
  <p>Syncing with other platforms - Ideally it would be able to sync with other platforms to automatically compile and update the list. I anticipate compatibility to sync lists with other services such as steam or an Xbox library to be the greatest obstacle and am only including this as a nice to have for the time being. </p>
  <p>Manual input - Users will have the ability to manually input their list of games and their own estimation of how long completion takes. Users will also be prompted to set parameters of completion for each title, for example an MMO might be x hours per month set indefinitely whereas a single player story-based game might be set to only complete the main line story or to 100% the game. </p>
  <p>Database building - Over time as more users are added I aim to build code which with the permission of users refines a scale including lower and higher time frames as well as averages as an aid to users in scheduling games to the calendar.</p>
  <p>Calendar function – A built in calendar which is populated with the days and blocks of time users allocate to their gaming will be used for games for scheduling game time as an aid to planning how they can clear their backlog and plan in up-and-coming titles around their free time. Part of the calendar function in unison with the users list will be the functionality for updating blocks of time on the fly in case they feel like playing a different title than what was planned. A status bar or wheel will be included for each individual title so users can take a snapshot of how far through the games they are depending on the level of completion they set in the criteria.</p>
  <p>Forums - A built-in forum would allow users to ask for guidance or give helpful suggestions to others and share experiences. Other information in the forums would include but are not limited to average playtime, a review page showing users comments on the games and a tips, hints, and tricks.</p>
  <p>Interactivity - Useful plugins to make their plans an interactive process and to give them a sense of control over how much time they spend gaming whilst having a way to track completion of all the titles they wish play. The app will also have a functionality to upload screenshots and write your own remarks for each game this will aid in picking up a game after putting it on hold for a while. This will also aim to build a sense of accomplishment with progress on the list of games and provide a good way remind you of your journey to completion when you look back at a later time.</p>

  <h3>Tools and Technologies </h3>
  <p>I will use the lean canvas to plan out my idea and find the relevant problem statement and identify users/buyers utilizing the agile method refine my idea in sprints.
I will need a programming tool and some art design to refine the look of my app.
Some research using resources on the internet will be crucial in order to establish exactly which tools will best assist me in creating my application and which are going to be either too difficult, too expensive or impractical for this task.
The technological hardware tools will be a computer and a mobile phone initially with an android OS and later an Apple IOS.
</p>
<h3>Skills Required </h3>
<p>I will have to learn the chosen software that I am to write as well as how to give my app the ability to link in with other platforms to help pull data such as a steam library or a console games list. I believe it will take some time to learn how to code/ build the required software.
I will require a test environment for my app I anticipate I will be able to accomplish this with a pc or mobile which I already have access to so this should be easy to overcome.
I will also need to be able to write my problem statement to determine if there is a need for my idea and to whom it will be targeted.
</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>Upon successful completion I will have an app that I can compile a list of games that I own which includes enough information to formulate a plan on how to play through all the games in my backlog as well as filling games into complete, in progress or coming up categories.
The app will also have the ability for you to write reviews, notes, tips and tricks and upload screenshots to help immortalize your journey through completing the games you are interested or passionate about.
Eventually I would like to create an additional capability to add friends and share your progress with each other and to offer community suggestions on beating a particular boss, level etc.
My app will give people a way to organize their library of games and to plan how to play through them solving the problem of building up a huge backlog of games that never get completed and to be able to share this with a community.
